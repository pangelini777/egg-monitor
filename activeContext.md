# EGG Monitor - Active Context

## Current Focus
- Project implementation
- Core functionality development
- Frontend and backend integration

## Recent Changes
- Created project documentation:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
- Implemented project structure:
  - Frontend (NextJS 14)
  - Backend (FastAPI)
  - Database (SQLite)
  - Docker configuration
- Developed core frontend components:
  - Main presentation screen
  - Admin panel
  - D3.js chart component
  - WebSocket hook for real-time data
- Implemented backend APIs:
  - User management
  - Sensor management
  - WebSocket server for real-time data
  - Mock data generation

## Next Steps
1. Test the integration between frontend and backend
2. Implement real-time data visualization with WebSockets
3. Test the containerized deployment with Docker
4. Add more comprehensive tests
5. Optimize performance
6. Prepare for deployment

## Active Decisions
- Using SQLite for simplicity in initial phase
- WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
- d3.js for data visualization
- Mock data generation for testing without real sensors

## Important Patterns
- Strict version control (NextJS14, Python 3.11)
- Clear separation between admin and presentation components
- WebSocket-based data flow
- RESTful API design for user and sensor management
- Component-based architecture for frontend
- Repository pattern for database access in backend
